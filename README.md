# Project 1 - Fantasy Football Picks

## Description
For our first group project we decided to create a fantasy football app. The primary purpose for this app is to inform you on recent news and up-to-date stats for every player. This will help anyone drafting for their fantasy football team. If we had funds for this project there is more specific stats and news we would have liked to implement.
